# PBJ
PBJ stands for Particles By Julia. Hopefully, this grows into a Julia-based particle simulation suite of functions and subroutines to be used for testing various particle-in-cell methods and techniques. 

I have a personal list of interesting algorithms to look at
1. Speed-limited PIC (SLPIC)
2. Particle-in-Fourier (PIF) 
3. Phase-space remapping
4. Asynchronous PIC

So far, SLPIC has been explored. Some PBJ benchmark cases are shown.
